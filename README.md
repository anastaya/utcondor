utcondor
========

The utcondor library provides Python tools for distributed computing on the [Condor](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/) platform at [UTCS](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/). These tools probably won't be useful to you unless you're a computer science graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin.

Overview
--------

Many simple distributed computing tasks can be modeled as a one-level parallel map: some function is executed over some set of inputs, and each result is handled as it becomes available. The utcondor library implements this model, which is primitive, but often good enough. For example, to square a range of numbers in distributed fashion:

```python
import condor
import this_module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    this_module.main()

def square(x):
    return x**2

def main():
    jobs = [(square, [x]) for x in range(16)]

    def handle_result(task, xx):
        print task.args, xx

    condor.do_or_distribute(jobs, 4, handle_result)
```

Installation
------------

Install the two dependencies; `pyzmq-static` is probably the easiest way to install the Python bindings to [Ã˜MQ](http://www.zeromq.org/):

```sh
$ pip install plac
$ pip install pyzmq-static
```

Then use waf to install utcondor into your local Python installation:

```sh
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf install
```
    
You're running inside a [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv), right?

Caveat Emptor
-------------

Be careful. Pay attention to whether Condor jobs are being successfully cleaned up. Use at your own risk.
