utcondor
========

The utcondor library provides Python tools for distributed computing on the
[Condor](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/) platform at
[UTCS](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/). These tools probably won't be useful to you
unless you're a computer science graduate student at the University of Texas at
Austin.

The goal of utcondor is a reliable implementation of a simple distributed
computing model. It requires little boilerplate, and switches easily between
local and remote execution.

Overview
--------

The utcondor library supports distributed computing tasks that can be cast as a
one-level parallel map: a function executed over multiple inputs on multiple
machines. This model is primitive, but easy to apply and often good enough. For
a trivial example, to square a range of numbers in distributed fashion:

```python
import condor
import this_module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    this_module.main()

def square(x):
    return x**2

def main():
    jobs = [(square, [x]) for x in range(16)]

    def receive(task, result):
        print task.args, result

    condor.do(jobs, 4, receive)
```

Any arguments passed to the remotely-executed callable must be pickleable.

Installation
------------

Install the two dependencies; `pyzmq-static` is probably the easiest way to
install the Python bindings to [Ã˜MQ](http://www.zeromq.org/):

```sh
$ pip install plac
$ pip install pyzmq-static
```

Then use waf to install utcondor into your local Python installation:

```sh
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf install
```

You're running inside a [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv),
right?

Caveat Emptor
-------------

Be careful. Pay attention to whether Condor jobs are being successfully cleaned
up. Use at your own risk.
